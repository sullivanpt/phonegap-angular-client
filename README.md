# phonegap-angular-client

Building out an Android App based on these instructions http://lucaspaulger.com/javascript/2013/09/25/Mobile-apps-Phonegap-Yeoman/

Goal is to create a OAuth2.0 client to use against the mean-sso project.

Warning:this code doesn't correctly talk to the cordova devices yet :-(.

## TODO

Considered swapping in grunt-angular-phonegap after making it work on Windows; actually, a better idea is to build 'generator-angular-phonegap' based on the generator-angular-fullstack proxy.
